### Desktop notifier in python

The score of currently ongoing matches will be notified on desktop.

So, in order to fetch the top headlines, we are using this Python script to scrape data.

The _topnews.py_ file contains the xml parsing and the _notify.py_ contains the interaction with D-Bus to faciliate the inter-process communication.
